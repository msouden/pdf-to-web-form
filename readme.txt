
Notes on use:

Attached is a utility I made to help speed up intake on Awarded referrals.

It makes an Icon you can drag Quote Awards to that will pre-fill out the referral form- to a degree.
It also opens the pdf. You will still need to do the following:
- review what's been filled in for accuracy.
- add anything missing.
- attach the order and the Quote Award

The utility will only currently capture one patient phone number. If there's an alt #, it needs to be copied over

right-click on the zip file and select "Extract All..."
